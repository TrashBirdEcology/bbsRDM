\title{Calculate the regime detection measured within a moving window.}
\usage{
rdm_window_analysisTEMP(dataInRDM, winMove = 0.25, overrideSiteErr = F,
  min.window.dat = 2, fi.equation = "7.12", to.calc = c("VI", "FI",
  "EWS"), fill = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataInRDM}{A data frame in long format. See description **NEED TO UPDATE THIS!**}

\item{winMove}{Number as proportion of each time series to be included in the moving windows. Default = 0.25 (25% of data included in each window).}

\item{min.window.dat}{Used in calc_FisherInformation. Default = 2 data points}

\item{to.calc}{Which measures to calculate. VI variance index. FI Fisher Information. EWS 1st through 4th moments, etc. Default = ALL measures.}

\item{fill}{Used in the function 'calculate_VI()'. Fill value for missing data. Default = 0}

\item{min.windowdat}{Minimum # of data points in each window to include in calculations. Default = 2.}
